# `sntp_cached`

A small Rust library to maintain a cache of NTP time, updating the cached NTP
time intermittently, while maintaining an internal clock to provide timestamps
without repeatedly querying an NTP server.

The intention is that for an application requiring frequent NTP timestamps,
this removes the burden and potential latency of making very frequent calls to
an SNTP server. Using a timestamp generated by measuring the time offset from
the last NTP timestamp received, the NTP time can be updated in the background,
allowing fast reads of a current timestamp whenever required, even if the
background update ends up taking some time.

Currently no guarantees are made with respect to the monotonicity of the clock.
Also, accuracy is likely to be lower than a fully-fledged NTP implementation.

This crate uses the delightfully simple
[sntp_request](https://github.com/risoflora/sntp_request) crate for NTP
timestamp requests.
